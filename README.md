# Protect-Women-App
**An App That Protects Women**

With the help of this app, we try to protect women of India from getting molested or abused or abducted, through a simple model created by us.

The model that we use, is very simple to comprehend. In the first step of our model, our app asks for the: name, guardian's phone number and guardian's email id; after that is done, we come to the second step of the model, which is the main section of our model. This step works, when the particular female user of our app feels that she is in an uncomfortable position; when this feeling occurs, the particular female user can press an 'Alert' button which shall lead to the final step of our model.
